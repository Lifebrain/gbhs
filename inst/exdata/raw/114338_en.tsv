E.g. breast cancer gene test and masectomy - you might have it but not develop a cancer; similarly mother died of brain anevrism, do I want to know if I have it? What do I gain by knowing? Would I only be more stressed? I find it more important to change as society; stop producing non-sense & stress; and foremost teach children to express emotions in a healthy way, to recognise bodily feelings and their message and how to cope with stress/ traumatic events.

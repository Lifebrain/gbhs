Hur mycket förlorar ”muskeln/hjärnan”när den inte används-när den vet vad den vill men inte når ut i kroppen med signalerna. Finns det verktyg för de som saknar ekonomi. Ska barn och vuxna med funktionsnedsättning(AD-HD) behöva falla mellan stolarna,detta för att spara pengar.  Världen går miste om fantastiska personer då insatser från skolan sätts in för att läsa in gymnasiet betyg...kostnaderna och behållningen för en stor grupp är bakvänd. Låt alla få betyda något,hitta rätt verktyg så kan man kanske sänka en hög procent sjukdomar. Se samband med våldsutsatta och cancersjukdomar? Oj så mycket jag skrev,vill mer.

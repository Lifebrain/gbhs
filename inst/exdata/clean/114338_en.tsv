Science will have to reevalute its possible scopes and purpose. E.g. breast cancer gene test and masectomy - you might have it but not develop a cancer; similarly mother died of brain anevrism, do I want to know if I have it? What do I gain by knowing? Would I only be more stressed? I find it more important to change as society; stop producing non-sense & stress; and foremost teach children to express emotions in a healthy way, to recognise bodily feelings and their message and how to cope with stress/ traumatic events.	NA	Because I believe in a healthy life style as being best prevention. Therefore, I am doing everything in my power to stay healthy and give the body chance to successfully regulate my homeostasis and well being. Should I fall short in doing so and fallen ill, I will get my diagnosis then. Moderen medicine is mainly and foremost a wonderful chirurgy.	Depending on a disease, my financial status at the time. I would focus on my child and secure a reasonable future for her.	Look for other stressors in my life and eliminate them or use proffessional help to better cope with them. Change my perspective.	I am already doing evrrything in my power.	NA	NA

Do you want to know if I do them to the same degree, purposefully or not? Eg. Do you compare if I answer that I do somthing frequently - but eg. rarely/never, purposefully for my brain health - and vice versa?!	This is a very theoretical question?! This would require a test that is VERY reliable for each brain disease.	NA	Again. What test? Seems very speculative. It really depends on the type of test.
